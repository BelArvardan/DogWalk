## Acknowledgment

Thank you to all the people, animals and large language models that gave me the resources and motivation to make this.

### Vladimir

Vladimir is my adopted German Shepherd/Husky Mix who was the inspiration behind making this. He also solely responsible for making sure that I put down my laptop and get some fresh air and excersize every day.

### Yuri Saurov

[Driglu4it](https://github.com/Driglu4it) is the creator of [CatWalk](https://store.kde.org/p/2137844) and is responsible for all of the code used in this project. All I really had to do was change a few words, icons and images.

### Takuto Nakamura

[Kyomeð“ƒ ](https://kyome.io/?lang=en) created [RunCat](https://kyome.io/runcat/index.html?lang=en), which was sited by [Driglu4it](https://github.com/Driglu4it) as the visual inspiration for his plasmoid CatWalk. I used and enjoyed [RunChenat](https://kyome.io/runcat/index.html?lang=en) when I was a mac user years ago.
